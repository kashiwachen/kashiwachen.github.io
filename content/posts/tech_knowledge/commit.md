Type: 
- feat: Add new features
- fix: Fix bugs
- docs: Edit documentation
- style: Edit the style, no effect on code
- refactor: Just refactor, no new feature and bug fixing
- test: Add unit test code
- chore: Update the core settings, like packages or some settings
- pref: Improve the performance

Body:
