# H3 geocoding system
- H3 merit
  - document
  - radius query (Uber expert)
  - fast speed (2.6ms per iteration)
  - enough functions for geospatial analysis
  - Hexagon shape
- more reference
  - complete system
  - need to try H3(input, output) with one day data.
  - And also check with geojson method

- basic research on trajectory prediciton
  - 1 paper about aircraft prediction with basic also.
- working on radiation attenuation metric script
